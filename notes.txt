R = roughness [0, 1]
M = metalness [0, 1]
C = angle to camera
L = angle to light
S = angle of reflected light vector to camera
I = IOR of material

F = fresnel at C=0
F = sq((1 - I) / (1 + I))

fresnel = F + (1 - R) * (1 - F) * sq(sq(1 - C)) * (1 - C)

E = phong "exponent"
E = 1 / (R + 0.01f)

M = specular multiplier
M = 1 / (R + 0.1f)

specular = M * S / (E - E * S + S)



//TODO: figure out how to derive phong exponent from roughness
//TODO: figure out how to derive specular multiplier from phong exponent
		(maybe integrate phong curve over [0, 1]?)
//TODO: figure out how metalness factors into all of this!
